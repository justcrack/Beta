- character pre-generation completed:
  -- PAL, CLR, BER, RNG, SHD, WAR, WIZ, ENC, BST, 


Welcome to a new Core..

Please read everyhing below. Then.. Fucking read it again. If, after the second go through, you have questions, feel free to ask.

Plugins Required: MQ2Cast, MQ2Exchange, MQ2MoveUtils, MQ2Debuffs, MQ2DanNet, MQ2SQLite, MQ2Nav
  
- file structure
  -- i've added 2 folders. 
    -- data: all data generated by core. i will not be placing anything into this folder. backup as you see fit
    -- script: files use to aid database or character generation. these files are fair game, i will be overwriting them if i need




BETA 0112.01
- ok, sice this has seemed to confused people since.. whenever..
- I have renamed the /buff group command to /buff other
- /buff [other] will buff other players in your group that you are  not boxing.. e.g other real players.
- BC Buffing
  -- I've rewritten it to use dannet observations instead of queries. i'm hoping this will keep better track of the 
     buffs on the target that the bufee is checking
- /core migrate has been moved to /admin migrate with rest of the sql commands. (missed it first time.. shit happens)
- most / commands have a second optional switch for supression. so /buff self on TRUE would tun on self buffs and echo nothing at all
  -- i will get through them all eventually
- fixed /class xtclass selection switch. not sure how i broke it. but its fixed now
- Custom Databases
  -- /mac TC\core.mac FRED4Prez will start core using a database named dbCore.FRED4Prez.db
  -- if you choose to do this, it will require configurations just like any other instance would
- class.clr.inc
  -- AA Beacon of Life will not fire on raids
  -- AA Silent Casting will not fire on raids


BETA: 0109.03
- I'm moving some commands around.
  -- I dont think the edit/list/view sql stuff belongs in the /core control
- /admin [get|list|table|maintenance|notice|reset|whitewash|zonereset]
	-- these are the same commands just under a different control. shouldnt need to use most of this stuff i just wanted it out of the way
- /admin list [unity|nuke|dot|buff|gom|clickitem|clickbuff|itemburn|itemswarm|now|odditem|bp|zone]
  -- couple more things for more detailed viewing
- corrected a few echos
- /take
  -- now works for trade window. Give or take as well as NPC trades
- more adjustments to the hud notification for characters that are auto or not
- class.clr.inc
  -- will no longer use AA Focused Celestial Regeneration on raids
	-- no more xtarget heal radius. this now works off your agro range
- class.pal.inc
	-- no more xtarget heal radius. this now works off your agro range
- class.shm.inc
	-- no more xtarget heal radius. this now works off your agro range
- class.dru.inc
	-- no more xtarget heal radius. this now works off your agro range


BETA: 0106.02
NEW COMMANDS
- /edit [variable] ["value"] (add|delete) for list items
  -- direct edit access to any variable in the database
  -- if you dont know what the variables are you can look in tc/data/cariable-list.txt or use /core [table] [tablename] to get a list
- /core []
  -- [table] will generate a list of all the database tables.
  -- table [tablename] will give you a list of all data in that table for your toon (tables will be listed if you leave it blank)
  -- [list] give a list of sub groups that make it simpler to see/understand what they are doing (evolving list)
	-- [get] [variable] will return the data of that sepcific variable only

- removed the following commands
  -- /stein incorporated into /port item
  -- /mirror incorporated into /port item
  -- /primary incorporated into /port item
  -- /secondary incorporated into /port item
  -- /anchor incorporated into /port item
  -- /comm [] command has been gutted. it's no longer there nor any of its' options

HUDUPDATE
- Manual Mode
  -- several changes to the logic while targeting a mob and not issuing a forced combat command
  -- this was needed to accomodate the new Heal combat mode
  -- also, i found my toons healing themselves w/o input in manual mode. hopefully they will stop that shit
- toggles / switches
  -- all toggles should now be three way. EG:
	  -- /core auto - will toggle between TRUE(on) and FALSE(off)
	  -- /core auto [on|TRUE] - will turn core automatic
	  -- /core auto [off|FALSE] - will turn core into self drive
  -- most / commands have had their logic changed so they do not need bool wrappers anymore.
- validate_cast()
  -- pulse will not sort out bard songs when validating songs.
     * this is a work in progress
- core_cast2()
  -- pulse will now seperate bard songs for casting purposes
     * also a work in progress
- /override combat is right fuck out
- please welcome your new overlord /cc heal
  -- /cc [heal] combat mode allows for preemptive healing even w/o a valid assist or mob to kill. but still allows getting an assist when there is one
  -- dont bug me anmymore about this. i will never speak of it again
  -- all classes have been adjusted to make use of this
- /setassist
  -- complete redesign for the database structure
  -- the switchs are now toggles. turning on one smart assist will turn off the other smart assists
  -- the toggles do not impact the MA assigned names. those still require input
  -- there is no longer a [x] bulk assist off option
- /cc pull
  -- if a valid target is found, the puller will be forced into combat. 
     this should stop the bounc back tot he home campp while waiting for the mob to get to group
- PETS
  -- summon componets are an exact match for item search
- removed the killcode. dont do stupid shit!
- REZZING
  -- groups take priority over raids now
  -- cleric should rez a little better when zoning in after a wipe
  -- /rez [token] if rez is enable and rez token is on, toons will use tokens to rez whatever classes are in lstRezToken=| ???

- Zoneing Delay
  -- altered it to be more aggressive.
- HUD
  -- LOTS of visual changes
  -- made the hudbroadcast pink.. /deal!
  -- removed the last tell. fuck those people
  -- the file hud.inc has been split up between pregen and declare
- /movement
  -- removed the < > restrictions. set them however you like 
  -- /movement [mount] [on] no longer in the water bitches
  -- [gather] now works off the crew numbers so /movement gather 1 would pull all of those listed in crew1 to you.
- /crew [1|2]
  -- /crew is now limited to Crew1 and Crew2 (can add more if needed)
  -- lstCrew1=|list|of|your|toon|names
  -- setCrew1Assist=name of your main assist
  -- setCrew1Leader=name of your master looter
- /gc [save|load]
  -- all output is now stored in the tc\data folder: gemcontrol.ini  
  -- if no name is enters it wil auto timestamp the entry with YYYMMDD
- database - the gooie stuff
  -- tables: |buff|pet|movement|character|mode|item|timer|${Me.Class.ShortName}|zone|environment
	-- all tables are character specific except zones and environment. environment is build specific, zone is.. well zone specific
- cast_AA_fade()
  -- will no longer fade just on damage alone. need mobs in combatRadius. which is a default of 30, unless you changed the shit
- HEALING (PAL,CLR,DRU,SHM)
  -- healing no longer uses ${spawn[ for any heal mode
  -- the adjustment to use ${Group.Member meand the healer will no longer heal itself if it is not in a group soooo..
  -- healers can now make use of the /heal [self] switch
  -- /heal [self] will not function while in a group. /heal [group] will not function while solo. the code will skip them respectively. this is a work in progress, i'm sure self healing will need some adjustments
- /port [wizard|druid|item] 
  -- /port [item] will list all the items i have added so far
  -- /port item [name] will click the personal port item
- dps click items and click swarm items
  -- limited the range to 100
