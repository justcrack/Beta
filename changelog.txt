BETA 0517.01
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHANGES. PLEASE READ SLOWLY!
DO NOT UPDATE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD!
	- the database has been redesigned. due to the way file sharing is implemented along with how sqlite locks on write, I have
	  split the database up. 
	- there is now a central database for all core base environment and static data that does not change
	- each character will maintain its own databas now that only it writes too
	- there has also been an adjustment on how environment variables are changed. the character that issues the command will write the change 
	  and issues /varset adjustments to everyone else. the other toons will not have to write the data
	- to accomodate this change just about every inch of SQLite code had to be adjusted
	- Hate me later, but you will have to redo your database. you can blame the people that try and do crazy assed things..
	- read the above line again...
	- you can still import the old INIs if you like
	- as a side benefit, you can share your character DB files now. no export required. just a rename of the file and table.

HUDUPDATE
- Manual Mode
  -- several changes to the logic while targeting a mob and not issuing a forced combat command
  -- this was needed to accomodate the new Heal combat mode
  -- also, i found my toons healing themselves w/o input in manual mode. hopefully they will stop that shit
- toggles / switches
  -- all toggles should now be three way. EG:
	  -- /core auto - will toggle between TRUE(on) and FALSE(off)
	  -- /core auto [on|TRUE] - will turn core automatic
	  -- /core auto [off|FALSE] - will turn core into self drive
  -- most / commands have had their logic changed so they do not need bool wrappers anymore.
- validate_cast()
  -- pulse will not sort out bard songs when validating songs.
     * this is a work in progress
- core_cast2()
  -- pulse will now seperate bard songs for casting purposes
     * also a work in progress
- /override combat is right fuck out
- please welcome your new overlord /cc heal
  -- /cc [heal] combat mode allows for preemptive healing even w/o a valid assist or mob to kill. but still allows getting an assist when there is one
  -- dont bug me anmymore about this. i will never speak of it again
  -- all classes have been adjusted to make use of this
- /setassist
  -- complete redesign for the database structure
  -- the switchs are now toggles. turning on one smart assist will turn off the other smart assists
  -- the toggles do not impact the MA assigned names. those still require input
  -- there is no longer a [x] bulk assist off option
- /cc pull
  -- if a valid target is found, the puller will be forced into combat. 
     this should stop the bounc back tot he home campp while waiting for the mob to get to group
- PETS
  -- summon componets are an exact match for item search
- removed the killcode. dont do stupid shit!
- REZZING
  -- groups take priority over raids now
  -- cleric should rez a little better when zoning in after a wipe
  -- /rez [token] if rez is enable and rez token is on, toons will use tokens to rez whatever classes are in lstRezToken=| ???

- Zoneing Delay
  -- altered it to be more aggressive.
- HUD
  -- LOTS of visual changes
  -- made the hudbroadcast pink.. /deal!
  -- removed the last tell. fuck those people
  -- the file hud.inc has been split up between pregen and declare
- /movement
  -- removed the < > restrictions. set them however you like 
  -- /movement [mount] [on] no longer in the water bitches
  -- [gather] now works off the crew numbers so /movement gather 1 would pull all of those listed in crew1 to you.
- /crew [1|2]
  -- /crew is now limited to Crew1 and Crew2 (can add more if needed)
  -- lstCrew1=|list|of|your|toon|names
  -- setCrew1Assist=name of your main assist
  -- setCrew1Leader=name of your master looter
- /gc [save|load]
  -- all output is now stored in the tc\data folder: gemcontrol.ini  
  -- if no name is enters it wil auto timestamp the entry with YYYMMDD
- database - the gooie stuff
  -- tables: |buff|pet|movement|character|mode|item|timer|${Me.Class.ShortName}|zone|environment
	-- all tables are character specific except zones and environment. environment is build specific, zone is.. well zone specific
- cast_AA_fade()
  -- will no longer fade just on damage alone. need mobs in combatRadius. which is a default of 30, unless you changed the shit
- HEALING (PAL,CLR,DRU,SHM)
  -- healing no longer uses ${spawn[ for any heal mode
  -- the adjustment to use ${Group.Member meand the healer will no longer heal itself if it is not in a group soooo..
  -- healers can now make use of the /heal [self] switch
  -- /heal [self] will not function while in a group. /heal [group] will not function while solo. the code will skip them respectively. this is a work in progress, i'm sure self healing will need some adjustments
- /port [wizard|druid|item] 
  -- /port [item] will list all the items i have added so far
  -- /port item [name] will click the personal port item
- dps click items and click swarm items
  -- limited the range to 100
- /mode [collect] this is designed to run a zone and collect nothing more than Glowing Globes
  -- you are on your own for levi and invis    
  -- complys with /mode agro range

	-- dots now have conditions
  -- adjusted cast timings to account for Metronome AA
