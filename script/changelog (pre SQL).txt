  -- PAL, CLR, BER, RNG, SHD, WAR, WIZ, ENC, BST, 


20181230.00
NOTICE: this build is the last to backend INIs for the mac and classes.
- class INI pregeneration
  -- more progress in the class pregeneration. If you see variables not loading, letme know
  - files: pregen.inc, core.pregen.ini, fixini.inc, core.mac, 
  - bard is complete
  - i cannot stress enough how big of a change this has been making to the ini structure. if you see something not working let me know
- core.ini
  -- corected the deathcount generation. variables will no longer have a '.' seperating them
- stacking issues
  -- replaced every instance of .Stacks with .NewStacks. maybe this will let classes buff the SKs
- /crew
  -- fixed another eqbc/dannet sort i missed.
- hud.inc
  -- fixed an undeclared variable
- class.shm.inc
  -- /shm [grow] enable/disable using growth line of spells
    ini example:
	  spellGrowth=Ferocious Growth
	  spellGrowthToon=|shamyname|tankname
	-- will keep growth on as many toons as it can in the list
- class.dru.inc
  -- fixed the pet fix. i blame the druids
  -- /dru [grow] enable/disable using growth line of spells
    ini example:
	  spellGrowth=Ferocious Growth
	  spellGrowthToon=|tankname|druidname
	-- will keep growth on as many toons as it can in the list
- class.enc.inc
  -- adjusted runeAuspice to work off the new check_buffs_tmp_list()

  -- corrected the AA malo Scent of Thule

  -- updated an error in Viscious Bite of Chaos. missed a comma
- class.rng.inc
  -- relocated a bunch of discs that were in the spells section of the INI


20181125.00
- assisting
  -- made some changes to how the MA1/MA2 assist works. you can now assist anything you like. Mercs, pets, a tree, whatever
  -- also (little rough to explain) /override combat will now work in conjunction with the normal combat roles (melee/range/nuke/dot)
  -- if you do actually get it to assist a tree, bonus points
- pet weapons
  -- added in an exceptions for druids and their slack pets only getting one weapon
- food and drink
  -- this is a complete rewrite. you will need to fix your INI entries
  -- each toon has INI entries under [Meal] these control eating and drinking
	-- if you have a clickie that summons food (or drink), it will keep that item and however many of the food on you you sepcify. for example:
		[Meal]
		Food=Fresh Cookie
		FoodDispenser=Fresh Cookie Dispenser
		FoodCount=10
		Drink=Spiced Iced Tea
		DrinkDispenser=Spiced Iced Tea Dispenser
		DrinkCount=10
	-- if you are like me and simply keep a metric ass tonne of misty thicket picnics and kaladim constitutions here is how its done:
		[Meal]
		Food=Misty Thicket Picnic
		FoodDispenser=FALSE
		FoodCount=0
		Drink=Kaladim Constitutional
		DrinkDispenser=FALSE
		DrinkCount=0
	-- Core will use these foods and save your stat food. This is calcualted at about the half way to hungry mark. So, you shoudnt even get close to using stat foods
	-- Also, this only works in auto mode. If you want this to function in manual, set the folowing entry in core.ini 
	  -- SwitchMealinManual=TRUE
- spellbook / gem control
  -- /gc [list|load|save] [name]
  -- /gc [list] will list all the saved gem listings you have for that class
  -- /gc [list] [name] will list all the spells by gem for that save
  -- /gc [load] [name] will load all the spells by gem onto your spellbar
	-- does not save/load the buffgem slot spell
  -- example core.ini saves:
	  [GC_CLR]
		110=|1|Merciful Remedy Rk. II|2|Spiritual Remedy Rk. III|3|Furial Renewal Rk. II|4|Merciful Intervention Rk. II|5|Mystical Intervention Rk. III|6|Undying Life|7|Syllable of Mending Rk. II|8|Elixir of Wulthan Rk. II|9|Sixteenth Serenity Rk. II|10|Shining Fortress Rk. II|11|Ward of Assurance Rk. II|12|Issuance of Mercy Rk. II

20181027.00
- Range Combat
  -- if you disable /cc melee and leave /cc range active, your toon will now try and stay a minimum of ~34 paces from the target so you can throw or bow the mob. 
  -- if you enable Melee, this will not happen and as soon as the mob is within 31 paces you will engage melee
  -- if this backs you off a cliff, please take pics for posterities sake. we can add it to the wiki as an example of what not to do
  -- also, the distance is not exact, keep in mind there is inertia and lag in the game. it should still be enough to range properly
-- added a FIND option to validate_cast() and core_cast2()
  -- eg: /if (${validate_cast[FALSE, FIND, "${Buff1}", ${Me.ID}]}) /call core_cast2 "${Buff1}" FIND ${Me.ID} FALSE
  -- will check to see if the buff is (in this order) spell,alt,disc,item and then cast it
- MQ2Melee

    - must be 3+ palladins in your agro range
    - will only cast if the spell is not on the target
    - spell must be memed and ready
  -- /splash
    - in manual mode, forces the pally to mem splash in its buffslot if it is not memed. HOWEVER, due to the recast, you will need to reissue the command if the script had to mem the spell
    - in auto mode you will need to mem the spell yourself.
    - if splash is memed it will drop splash at its feet.
    - if you have /heal cure enabled on the pally, it will use this automagically

20181019.00
- HUDs
	the /hc update and delete commands now take an option eg. /hc update debug or /hc delete core
	I have added in a HUD for debugging, it is simpler to deal with then the 5 billion lines scrolled in the MQ window
	if you want to use it, feel free, can get it working by doing the following commands:
	/loadhud debug
	/hc update debug
	it apears just below the normal HUD
	if you want to get rid of it, do a:
	/hc delete debug
	it will pass a lot of information the normal HUD does not, lines, IDS, timers, current sub, so on
	more will be added to it as i need
	if you have no desire to use it, feel free to just ignore everything you just read
	on a side note, this will let you design a HUD all your own if you like. just follow the patterns	
- #turbo
	so, i threw in a #turbo 120 at the start of core.mac
	i'm gonna play around with this for a while and see if it does not screw up any of the timings
	if it is cooperative, i see no reason it cannot stay in there to speed the mac up a bit
	if anyone sees the mac cycling something odd or too fast, try lowering the turbo on your side to see if that helps
	last i read on the forums, the default is 80 when turbo is undefined. so this is a fairly big boost
- CHECKINPUTS
  -- the /multiline simnply wasnt doing it. so i turned it into a sub. works a lot better now
- class.mnk.inc
  -- dont ask what i did, i'm not really sure. but its fixxed..  man that was ugly...
- class.mag.inc
  -- corrected a misspelling of DEBUG. going to add this to the cannot spell continue list
- Healers
  -- /override combat was adjusted to at least let them heal group and xtargets 
- class.ALL.inc
  -- adjusted the patterns for manual inputs/interjections for all classes
  -- eg. manual mode and hitting a force combat or a stop or any other bind command
     given the class loop changes this should help them respond a bit faster
- fixed some other things. but forgot what they were, /shrug
  

20181017.00
- /port [wizard|druid] [location]
  -- /port with no switches will issues available switches as normal
  -- /port wizard or druid will issue the avialable ports for that class
- in mac Wiki - some updates
- /coh [group]
  -- /coh no paramaters will coh the command issuer with AA
  -- /coh [group] well, if you haven't figured out the pattern by now
- Xtarget heal list population
  -- shouldnt put pets on there anymore. i hope.. fuck pets anyway
- some small adjustments prep_combat() and exit_class_loop() for manual mode. trying to get it to only execute when forced
- residentmage, druid and wizard settings from the individual classes have been moved to core.ini->[group]. FIX YOUR INIs
  -- if you have to ask. i was seriously tired of editing the same setting over and over
- class.pal/clr.inc
	-- corrected the variable types for yaulp and the yaulp%. they should not have been strings
- class.clr/dru/shm.inc
  -- adjusted the exits on the class loop so xtarget healing and curing will cooperate with /override combat
  

20181011.00
HUDUPDATE
  -- Off Tank notification added next to Agro and Pull
  -- in agro range mob count added next to Combatradius number
  -- fixed the [X] markers for 2 override engage settings (cosmetic)
-- cosmetic updates to the Info switch1
- OffTank
  -- /cc offtank (on/off) enable disable offtank mode
  -- off tank will watch mobs in its area and tank those that are either in the nomezz list for that zone or are named that the main assist has not picked up yet.
  -- once the Main assits picks them up, the offtank will return to a DPS type
  -- NOITCE --- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.. it will ned some attention.
  -- really, i'm not even sure it will work right yet. so don't expect a lot.
- re-wrote the following commands to obey the /comm decision
  -- /killmob
  -- /here
  -- /on
  -- /off
  -- /setassist f 
  -- /cc force assist
  -- /enter
  -- /bcsay
  -- /gtfo
- /campfire [drop|port]
  -- /campfire [port] simply clicks your campfire isnignia
  -- /campfire [drop] will place a camp fire at your feet if 3+ members are in a 50' range
- sort_cursor()
  -- adjusted from a /while loot to an /if
  -- was causing some sort of crash. may be an issue with nested /while loops in MQ /shrug
- prep_combat()
  -- forgot to account for auto off && override combat .. /sigh
  -- manual mode was maintaining the target ID even after an ESC was hit. we had a talk. it's not doing it anymore

  -- cosmetic changes to the /wiz command. just a little more info displayed
- Familiars
  -- there is now support for 3 familiars.
  -- it is still your responsibility to sort stacking slots
  -- here is my ini sample:
	  SumFamiliar1=Emperor Ganak Familiar
		SumFamiliar1Buff=Familiar: Emperor Ganak
		SumFamiliar1Leave=TRUE
		SumFamiliar2=Razors Edge
		SumFamiliar2Buff=Familiar: Razors Edge
		SumFamiliar2Leave=TRUE
		SumFamiliar3=Venomous Raptor Familiar
		SumFamiliar3Buff=Venomous Raptor Familiar
		SumFamiliar3Leave=FALSE
  -- YOU WILL NEED TO FIX YOUR INI.
  -- you DO NOT need to use the "Auto Leave" button on the familiar keyring

	
20181002.00
- Seriously... Read this..
  In an attempt to write out the /goto in the main class loops I managed to create a constant crash in the mac caused by the burn routines.
  So, to fix this. I have rewritten the following routines:
  if you find the code acting in a way it shouldnt, let me know.
  -- prep_combat()
  -- is_burn_time()
     -- only sets a bool switch that lets the class loop execute burn routines. switch is reset after every kill. the normal burn controls and conditions still apply
  -- is_valid_target() is now validate_target()
     -- the new routine only returns a bool depending on the input mob ID. Where as it used to execute the burn routines as well as set several variable adjustments.
  -- Burn routines are now executed after combat is set in the main class routine (second line except for zerkers). 
- check_buffs_BC()
  -- shouldnt.. hopefully, bcbuff pets anymore
- class loop controls
  -- I am removing the /goto loops fom the main class loop in their .INC files.
- broadcast_status()
  -- logic correction for dannet addition
- cast_cure()
  -- corrected a misspelling
- class.clr.inc
  - adjustments to check_heal_ward()
  - removed cast_temp_pet_CLR(). now uses the common cast_temp_pet()
  - moved the AA hammer pet to the disc routines
  - rewrite of the single target HOT spell

  -- /comm [eqbc] set Core to work off EQBC/NetBots

- Custom Work
  -- as a request, I've added a custom.inc file to Core's initialization
  -- in the custom.inc is a declare routine that is called on initial start
  -- this will allow people to create their own INI variables and initialize them with the same /call routines that are in the declare.inc file
  -- you can also add whatever functions want in custom.inc and call them or binds, or whatever.
  -- i will not be changing this file. by default, this is a blank routine in an otherwise empty file
  -- if you find you've built something useful, let me know, always looking for new ideas

     sets the class you want to use on xtarget healing

  -- small adjustment to cani to watch group health
- HEALERS -- (Paladin, Cleric, Shaman, Druid) !!

HUDUPDATE
- there is now a G in the buffs line for group buffing
** WARNING...
- the next two commands are rather obtrusive and intensive.
-- in order to verify a buff on a person not in your Netbots BC, they have to examin the toon, verify every buff with what they want to cast and then cast and set timers.
-- so your, at max, looking at 42 buff slots with 15 possible buffs in Core. so, up to 630 iterations per group member as a worst case senario.
-- in the testing it was averaging about 2 seconds per toon. which isnt bad.
-- i do not suggest setting this for a short timer. the default will be 5 min. adjust at your own peril.
** consider yourself warned...

- /buff [group] - will enable buffing people in your group
  -- feeds off of ManualBuff#Class=|WAR|PAL|SHD|BRD|BST|BER|MNK|ROG|WIZ|MAG|ENC|NEC|CLR|DRU|SHM in the toons INI
  -- default check time is every 5 min
  -- this will not buff you. just everyone else (except mercs).
- /buff [merc] - to enable buffing mercs. don't ask me why..
  -- is set to feed off of ManualBuff#Class now and NOT raidbuff#class.
  -- mercs work off class, just like a normal toon does

- new file: namelistdata.ini
  -- last 6 xpacs of named for every zone (thanks to achilles2017 for providing the list)
  -- empty named lists will auto update upon entering the zone. this can be disabled with core.ini->[general]->autoAddNameList=FALSE
  -- the auto update does NOT overwrite the namelist if something is already there. issue the command "/core fixini namelist" if you want it forced
  -- if you want older xpacs. send me the info in the same format as the namelistdata.ini file. i'll add it to the master list
- /core fixini [NULL|old|namelist]
  -- i had to adjust this to accomodate more options then a TRUE|FALSE. 
  -- /core fixini - will simply remove current ini entries that are no longer valid. this is forced on every new build date
  -- /core fixini [old] - removes as many of the old ini entries as i have kept track of over the build cycles
  -- /core fixini [namelist] - will update your namelist according to the data maintained in namelistdata.ini for the zone you are in.

- banestrike now has a condition. evaluate for TRUE to use. just like normal casting
- prep_combat()
  -- so i managed to write in my own little paradox of sorts. any target was being intrepreted as valid even w/o forcing combat in manual mode. i blame the clerics.

  -- removed elemental arrows timers. will keep them on cooldown now
  -- elemental arrows cycle proper now. (DB changed the target buff name and didnt notice)
  -- moved get_agro_RNG() body to discs
  -- moved cast_AA_Elemental_arrows() body to discs
  -- summer nuke is tied to both the summer switch and nuke switch. turning either off will stop summer nukes

  -- typo in harmonious
- class.enc.inc

- all classes
  -- no longer send pets to a forced combat target while in manual.
  -- HEALERS now need to use an assist. moving on...
  -- HEALERS will maintain more focus on the last person they healed. unless you have them doing something else besides healing
*NEW casting routines*  
- these will be migrated as i have time.
- validate_cast()
  -- EG. ${validate_cast[spell|disc|item|alt, "NAME OF THING", TARGETID]}  
  -- returns TRUE if able to cast FALSE if not
  -- this is part 1 of the split of core_cast.
- core_cast2()
  -- slimmer casting routine. never has to hit it if fails validate_cast()
- support for non gold (paid) accounts is no more. i really don't feel like mainting that code too
- switchAlwaysFaceTarget has been removed. casters dont need to face the god damn target
- logic error in rest routine for classes w/o rest/breather disc line
- ALL modes are being depreciated. [HEAL,MELEE,RANGE,NUKE,DUAL]
new switches for combat
- /cc [melee|range|nuke|dot]

  -- range - is range items as defined in the ini and usable by /range or /autofire command
  -- nuke - enables anything defined in the nukes routine in the INI
  -- dot - enablesd anything defined in the DOT routine in the INI
  -- enabeling both melee and range will allow auto switching based on range to target (31 paces is the magic number)
  -- any combination can be used.
- /cc force[combat] - will force combat when in manual mode
  -- there is no more force [melee|range|nuke|heal|dual] (they are gone)
** HEALING !!!!!!
- healing is now tied directly to combat. if the healer is not in combat, it will not heal
- this includes resting. no combat = NO heal for you! (repleate outloud w/broken english in turkish accent)
- this fixes the cleric dumping all its AA emergency heals when zoning into a zone.
- will not heal on puller incomming either.
- WTF you say? no heals on incomming.. yah, thats right.
- if you dont like this change. see the override addition for combatheal (IE keep reading)
- /override [combatheal]
  -- combatheal - ENABLED allows the healers to ignore the prep_combat requirement of being in combat to reach their heal routines. works for rest as well.
    -- this override will also get you past the requirement of a healer needing an assist.
    -- this override is tied to the toons agro range
    -- this unfixes the cleric dumping all its AA heals. (refer to previous fix)
- /here
  -- removed class modes from core.ini. if you still see them do /core fixini
- prep_combat()
  -- rewrite.. cause. well it needed it... we trust nothing now.

- broadcast_status() rewrite. should be a little more gooder...
- rename DeclareIniVar() -> setINIVar()
- events.inc
  -- 16 anni stein event - fixed some typos

  -- toon.ini -> [mode] -> |alteration|abjuration|conjuration|divination|evocation

  -- switchDispEXP=TRUE/FALSE - (cosmetic) display exp adjustments 
  -- switchAADiscnowManual=TRUE/FALSE - enable/disable AA and Disc Now abilities to run while in manual mode as well as auto 
  ** note: all variables set in Core.INI effect all toons. they are manual settings and require a mac restart to engage them.


20180310
/setassist [x|1 NAME|2 NAME|(g)roup|(r)aid|(f)orce]
  -- direct access to setting assists.
  [x] - disables ALL assists
  [1 NAME] - 1,MA1 set the toon namual assist to NAME
  [2 NAME] - 2,MA2 set the toon namual assist to NAME
  [(g)roup] - g or group sets the toon to assist the group MA
  [(r)aid] - r or raid, sets the toon to assit the raid MA
  [(f)orce] - f or force, sets the toon to accept forced assist commands 
incorporation of MQ2Nav
  -- /tc mode [nav|stick]
    -- /tc mode nav - will use MQ2NAv genereated meshes for /tie
       NOTE: the movement is block(y), moving to the last registered point of the character tied too. then adjusta gain to catch up.
    -- /tc mode stick - will use MQ2MoveUtils for /tie
/movement [gather CREW] - will pull all your group members, as defined by the crew settings in core.ini to the command issuer
/movement goto [NAME|TARGET] - navigates you to the target
- set_stick()
  -- more changes to the logic. the MQ2Nav method is still a little off.
- core.ini->[no]->heallist=|NAME|NAME|NAME
  -- set people you do not want to ever heal. because some people are just absolute cunts.  
- class.wiz.inc
  -- spellConcussion = Concussion Spell you want wizzy to use when agro gets too much for your squish ass to handle
  -- spellConcussionPct = when you want the concussion spell to fire
- AA / Disc now controlls    
  -- core.ini->[General]->switchAADiscnowManual= TRUE to use AA and Disc now while in manual. FALSE by default
  
  
* NOTES ON MQ2NAV
- if you dont generate the mesh for the zone, dont bother using this feature.
- the nav segment of /tie works a little differently. it will nav to the tie toons position, once there, will calculate to where the toon has moved too and regenerate the nav and move again.
  this causes tie to move in segments very different the MQ2MoveUtils stick method. However, there are very little geometry collision issues.
- this is a work in progress. i'm still learning this new method and getting it to work with core.
- yes, i know this opens the door for completely automated AFK killing. don't expect that to happen beyond the harvest and slaughter/hunt modes.  
- i have not worked this into the alternate /mode(s) yet. But I plan too.
- the /movement goto command takes you to the targets position at time of issue. thats is.
- the /movement gather [CREW] command works off the CREW settings in core.ini. if you're not using the group settings in this, this command will do nothing for you.
- this is not a required plugin to function.

HUDUPDATE
- Forced Assist (needs lots of testing)
  -- this is a forced assist you will need to set up a hotkey like the following to use this
    -- /cc force assist .. this command will send the targets ID to all your BC toons as the target to kill
    -- you will need to have the mob targeted you want your group to kill
  ** NOTES
     remember, the toons will still comply with all the nomal combat physics, line of sight, mezed mobs, mobs HPs
 	-- /cc forceassist to enable or disable
	-- turning on forceassist will disable the other assists (group/raid/ma1/ma2)
	-- Mob engage HP settings still apply when not using an override
- class.clr.inc

20180131
- disabled /core [fireworks] in raids. was kinda funny... kinda..
- remove buffs now using /invoke
- loot | loot file | /cursor
  -- ok so there was a request to be able to pass loot to a person.
  -- this requires changes to the core.loot.ini file to be able to accommodate more the one choice.
  -- items will be stored like the following
  -- Blue Diamond=|Keep
  -- to pass an item to a person use the following example
  -- Blue Diamond=|Keep|Fred
  -- this will pass the item to Fred if he is in your group. otherwise you still keep it. or whatever you have it set too
  -- the /cursor commands still operate
  -- manual editing of the file is required to add a person to pass the item too. (I'll work on a way to automate it)
  -- Core will adjust the entries to the new format as each item is looted, so.. it may take a time to get through them all. can always do a mass change on your own if you like
  -- changing the /cursor [keep|loot|ignore..so on] status of an item will not change the the second value of a name to pass it to, if there is one.

	-- each line has an associated spam Claw Line spell that attempts to trigger Twincast 
	-- each line has up to 8 conditions. 1 for each spell

20171228
- changes to how rezzes work.
  -- in the past: Core would detect a death and lock you in to the rez routines.. this was by design to prevent the toon from doing stupid shit while waiting to get a rez
     a couple patches back for MQ2, Core started generating a random complete client crash on deaths. no dumps. just a complete lock.
  -- Now, it is set in to two sections. 1st, simply watches for a death. if one is found, you are tagged as a toon that has had its ass manhandled.
  -- 2nd, once tagged, it will let you do stuff and keep an eye out for a rez box. if it finds one, it will click the correct %.
  -- death markers/time markers are now shown in the warnings on the HUD, not in the mode.
  -- manual mode will still watch for a rez box if /rez take is enabled but it will not prevent forced casting. e.g. /sb or /ib
  -- shaman, druid, paladin should choose the 96% rez when out of combat.
- check_exit()

20171207
HUDUPDATE
- updates to inmacro wiki
- fixed the dumb xpac checker
- clients w/o underfoot expansion will not be able to assist using smartma anymore
- /cc combatradius is now by toon not macro
- correcting a lot of / command outputs to follow the same pattern
- complete reworking of the smart assist / commands
  -- /cc smartma [1|2|G|X|NULL]
  -- /cc smartma 1 sets toon to raid assist 1
  -- /cc smartma 2 sets toon to raid assist 2
  -- /cc smartma G sets toon to group assist
  -- /cc smartma X disables all smart assists
  -- /cc smartma NULL - is a 4 way cycle that will cycle through all the smart assist modes
  -- the /bc alias sma1,sma2,smag,smax all redirect to /cc smartma
  -- the bind /smartma redirects to /cc smarma
  -- /cc smartma has no effect on MA1 or MA2 settings.
- get_assist_target() 
  -- adjusted to redirect to new Bind_setCombatControl()
- class.enc.inc
  -- /enc [charm] enables using charm spell or divine charm to charm mobs. (will default to divine if mob is lvl 46 or less and aa available)
  -- find_mob_to_charm()

  -- requires /enc charm enabled

  -- chanter will ae mezz if a mob is detected that it can charm, tash it, if it is not, then attempt to charm.
- class.brd.inc
  -- adjusted pulse_stop() check and added to clear_combat()
  
NOTE - Group Assisting (2 things)
- expansion 16 is underfoot. 16 was the release of extended targets. Core makes extensive use of extended targets. 
  However, some servers do not have underfoot. this was causing errors. smart assist has been disabled for anyone that does not have expansion 16

- the assist fallbacks are being adjusted. while using group smart assist, you can still set MA1 and MA2. If something happens to the Group Assist
  MA1 will take over. if MA1 is unavailable or dead or not in zone or whatever, MA2 will take over. these are automatic. do not need to turn off 
  smartassist for the MAs to assume responsibility any more. this process DOES NOT work for RAID assist. MQ does not posses a way to find the raid 1/2
  Assist toons name. we can only pull the RaidAssist which is limited to the first raid assist. Still have not decided how i want to handle this.

  
20171204

20171124

- get_target()
  -- this is the pull routine for.. the puller. it has been changed.
  -- it will not longer search the immediate combatRange (default 30) for mobs, then search the full agro range.
    -- this was causing mobs to be selected by the entire mob ranged based on spawn orders. so it would pull mobs farther while ones were closer.
  -- it now turns the pullers agro range in to steps of 10. the routine will cycle each step looking for a mob. when a valid one is found. that will be the target and the loop is broken.
  -- pets will continue to remain dead last as long as valid targets are available.


20171123

  -- /echos [alt|bc|channel|disc|item|melee|spells|relay|verbose]
  -- NOTE: ALL echo controlls are moved to here. verbose, echochannel, relay. you will need to reset them if they are being used
  -- NOTE: it will take time to get these echos through the code to replace the generic VOUT echo.

    -- SwitchEchoSpell - echo spells to BC
    -- SwitchEchoAlt - echo alt abilities to BC
    -- SwitchEchoDisc - echo discs to BC

20171112

- class.clr.inc / class.pal.inc
  -- /clr yaulp [##] - will set the % to use yaulp
  -- /clr yaulp - will enable/disable yaulp
  -- toon.ini->[buffs]->spellYaulp=[name of yaulp spell you wish to use]

    -- spell is set in INI and memed.
    -- donals helm from SS hardcore if you have one.

20171109
- added in nuke/DoT pre-evaluations
  -- loosely based off RD macro EvaluatioCondition() function at Stockli's request
  -- toon.ini->[spells]->Nuke##Condition= (FALSE by DEFAULT)
  -- the INI setting is NOT parsed. proper variables are used e.g. ${Me.ID}
  -- the condition is paired with the nuke being cast
  -- setting the condition to FALSE will disable the check
  -- e.g. ${Target.Name.NotEqual[Fred]}  .. would evaluate the target as not being named Fred before nuking it
  -- e.g. ${Me.PctAggro} < 90  .. would make sure my agro is below 90% before nuking target
  -- you are looking to check that things are TRUE. if the evaluation is FALSE, the spell will not be cast
  -- keep mind core_cast() pre evaluates, mana/endurance costs, range, LOS, spell/item/disc/aa are ready, self stacking, elemental resist types, Gift of Manna procs, you're dead, and some other basic things   
  -- INI example: ranger
    -- Nuke1=Anticipated Shots
    -- Nuke1Condition=${Me.PctAggro} < 70 || (${Select[${Me.Class.ShortName},RNG]} && !${Me.DisplayName.Equal[FRED]})
    -- Nuke2=Focused Arrowrain

- class.brd.inc
  -- bad /if-else flow for new restsong switch... still not tested this.


20171102
- logic change for tash/malo/cripple
  -- leaving the ini entrie class.ini->[spell]spellTash,malo,slow,cripple as FALSE but enabeling the /debuf mode for that skill will force the class to use the AA. otherwise put the spell in the INI
  -- THIS NEEDS A LOT OF TESTING!!!

  -- easy hotkey for switching /bct clericname //clr rampage ${Target.DisplayName}
